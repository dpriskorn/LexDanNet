## What I learned
* chatGPT needs a lot of handholding when it comes to WikibaseIntegrator. It produces garbage.
* Small projects like this still takes hours to do which is rather surprising, we need better/simpler infrastructure
* WikibaseIntegrator has no helper method to check if it has logged in or not https://github.com/LeMyst/WikibaseIntegrator/issues/638
